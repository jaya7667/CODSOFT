These tasks are given by CODSOFT during an internship program. The tasks are as follows:-

TASK 1: SPAM SMS DETECTION

    Build an AI model that can classify SMS messages as spam or
    legitimate. Use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with
    classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
    Machines to identify spam messages
    
TASK 2 : MOVIE GENRE CLASSIFICATION

    Create a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a
    movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. You
    can use techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings with classifiers
    such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector
    Machines.

TASK 3 : CREDIT CARD DETECTION

    Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Use a
    dataset containing information about credit card transactions, and
    experiment with algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees,
    or Random Forests to classify transactions as fraudulent or
    legitimate.
